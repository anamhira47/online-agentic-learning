# Online Agentic Learning

- Using Context Free grammars for deterministic model parsing.

- Speculative sampling for faster generations of tokens. Using rejection sampling based on CFG state.
    - Using smaller model to generate tokens for the grammar structure
    - Using larger LLM for decisions 
- Fine Tuning with forward passes to learn use case with forward passes only at inference time
